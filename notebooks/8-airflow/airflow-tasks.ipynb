    "- You can mock the day computation to use a fixed day (since we don't receive daily data)\n",
    "- Airflow provides an operator called `airflow.contrib.sensors.file_sensor.FileSensor` to check for the presence of files and directories.\n",
    "- Python functions can be executed via the `airflow.operators.python_operator.PythonOperator`.\n",
